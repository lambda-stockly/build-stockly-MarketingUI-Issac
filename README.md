# build-stockly-MarketingUI-Isaac

# Project Title

Web design and development of Σtockly, an application that uses sentiment analysis to predict stock prices.

## Role in Project

My primary role on the project as a User Interface Developer was to build a multi-page marketing website.

Given that we had no UX Designer, I designed the moodboards for the team and got agreement on the preferred style off the app. From that point, I designed mock-ups using Figma to guide the development of the website while providing the team with assets. 

The marketing website has been built using HTML, LESS, and JavaScript. It has been completed from a mobile-first perspective, consequently having breakpoints that align with desktop widths. The main call to action redirects the user to the front-end of the application which then receives data from the backend. The website also has PWA functionality, allowing users to download it directly to their mobile phones.

## Getting Started

This project has been completed using html, less, and javaScript. To run locally, simply fork this project and execute the index.html file. If you wish to make changes via less, you'll need to install it locally on your machine or import it via a script.
